# React-Crud-Conta-azul

The use was done accordingly the requirements with a few reservations that will be explained in the roadmap.

I took this opportunity to make a webapp with only react, without redux and jQuery


## Installation

The installation of the development environment is up to npm and the dependencies manager I've adopted the yarn due to his performance. so,

1. Go to the project folder in your CLI, and `npm install`
2. Run the webpack dev server, I already made a script to sort things out, run `npm run dev`
3. Run the application in the default port setted by webpack-dev-server ( currently 8080)
